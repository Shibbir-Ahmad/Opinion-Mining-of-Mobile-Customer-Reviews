# Opinion-Mining-of-Mobile-Customer-Reviews

In this research project, I have worked to do opinion mining of mobile customer reviews using five supervised machine learning algorithms.

Key Points-

•	developed a machine learning model that outperformed state of the art models to classify five types of opinion in terms of mobile customer tweet reviews dataset collected from Kaggle

•	replaced the emoji and emoticons with suitable English texts, applied Tokenization, replaced negation with antonym, removed Stopwords and applied Lemmatization

•	used python TextBlob library to get the float values of polarity for all tweets and assigned the threshold values of polarity with respect to five opinion classes

•	applied Bag of Words and TF-IDF feature extraction methods and five machine learning algorithms

•	Programming Language: Python

•	Algorithms: SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

•	Tools: Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Google Colab
